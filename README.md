#DeepFileFind
The goal of this project is to create the most satisfying search program in the world. DeepFileFind...

* Has features you need
* Isn't annoying
* Is GPL (free as in freedom, forever--redistribute modify according to the terms as you wish)

--in other words, it's a program like nothing before it.

## Key features
* Search partial name (without requiring any type of wildcard notation)
* Modification Date Range (time is optional for each)
* Open a found file by right-clicking on a result file (or optionally open the folder that contains it)

## Philosophy
* Intuitive: just try to use it and it works
* For end users (will never have regex; has justifiable and readily usable defaults)
* Isn't annoying (no search index; will never have panels other than search and results; no tabs)

## Known Issues
* Add wildcard notation
* Fix flicker on list when each file is found
* Implement content search
* Add sorting by any column (sort again at end of search)
* Warn&confirm if results would be every file in folder
* Add created date range
* Search within zip files optionally
* Search content of zipped xml files (*.*x office files, and iWork(R) files)
