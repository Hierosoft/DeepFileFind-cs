# More Control of Options, Better Recursion Accuracy
3.0.0

### New Features
* Save entire list (from File menu)!
* Delete actual files from entire list (from File menu)!
* Added checkboxes for options that were previously hidden

### Important Fixes
* fixed drive searching bug (still intentionally doesn't recurse into mounted drives, but does search them if specified even if OS marks them as system)
* content search stability
* check correct attributes resulting in all possible results and skipping the correctly identified unusable files & directories (see README.md included in archive below)
