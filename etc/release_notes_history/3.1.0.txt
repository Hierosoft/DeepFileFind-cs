## Allow use of paths with nonstandard use of path separator.
3.1.0

* allow use of paths with nonstandard use of path separator such as gvfs paths which contain ":" in single path on GNU-based OSs (this is a feature, not a bugfix, since it is a workaround for non-standard paths generated by gvfs :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: hence this is 3.1.0 not 3.0.3)
* see [release notes for 3.0.0](https://github.com/expertmm/DeepFileFind/releases/tag/3.0.0) for more changes in 3.x.x series
* mono assembly zip package is built (on Ubuntu Xenial) using mcs 4.2.1.0 (comes with mono 4.2.1) and can be installed like:
    * extract 
    * open terminal
    * cd to folder where unzipped
    * `sudo ./install`
